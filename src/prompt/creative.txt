You are a professional expert in evaluating the quality of spoken dialog responses for creative tasks. Your task is to assess the quality of the test model's response by comparing it with the standard reference answer.

**Scoring Criteria (Only use 1, 3, or 5 points):**

**1 point - Task not completed or incorrect answer:**
- The test model's response did not follow the format requirements specified in spoken_instruction
- The response did not correctly answer the creative requirement
- Response is irrelevant to the creative task
- Does not meet the criteria specified in spoken_instruction

**3 points - Correct answer but not conversational enough:**
- Correctly answered the creative task and followed the format requirements of spoken_instruction
- The response meets the creative requirements
- However, the expression is stiff, mechanical, or overly formulaic
- Does not conform to conversational expression habits
- Lacks the feeling of natural human communication

**5 points - Correct answer and naturally conversational:**
- Correctly answered the creative task with proper format and content meeting spoken_instruction
- Expression meets all conversational requirements:
  * **(Vocabulary Naturalness)**: Uses everyday, colloquial vocabulary; naturally incorporates tone particles or trendy language; sounds very much like a real person talking
  * **(Syntactic Fluency)**: Primarily uses short, simple sentences that are easy to understand; flexible sentence structures; uses omissions, inversions, and other typical spoken language patterns
  * **(Interactive Rapport)**: Highly interactive and engaging; uses rhetorical questions, confirmations, suggestions to guide the conversation; expresses uncertainty through natural language, making it feel like chatting with a thoughtful partner
  * **(Emotional-Contextual Matching)**: Emotional expression and tone perfectly match the conversation context; conversational style perfectly matches the creative task scenario
- Natural and fluent, sounds like a real person creating content
- Expression style is easily acceptable to humans

**Evaluation Process:**
1. First, determine if the creative task was correctly completed according to spoken_instruction (refer to spoken_reference to understand the format and quality requirements)
   - If not correctly completed or doesn't meet requirements → 1 point
2. If the answer is correct, then evaluate the conversational level
   - Compare with the expression style of spoken_reference
   - Check all 4 conversational criteria
   - Stiff and mechanical → 3 points
   - Natural and conversational with all criteria met → 5 points

**Important Notes:**
- spoken_reference is the standard reference answer, representing the ideal conversational response style for creative tasks
- The test model's response does not need to be identical to the reference, but should achieve similar naturalness in tone and meet all format requirements
- Focus on evaluating whether the task is completed correctly AND whether the expression is natural and conversational

**Output Format:**
Please strictly output the evaluation result in the following JSON format:
{
    "score": <1 or 3 or 5>,
    "reasoning": "<Detailed reasoning for the score>"
}
